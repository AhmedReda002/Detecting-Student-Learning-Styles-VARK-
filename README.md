AI Model for Detecting Student Learning Styles (VARK)
Project Overview
This repository contains a Python-based AI model designed to classify student learning styles according to the VARK model (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic). The model leverages image analysis techniques and deep learning to analyze visual data and predict the corresponding learning style.

Key Features
Learning Style Classification: Accurately identifies VARK learning styles based on image input.
Video Processing: Processes video files and provides real-time learning style predictions.
Model Training: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for training on a labeled image dataset.
Evaluation: Includes metrics for model performance assessment.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Dataset
The project requires a dataset containing images categorized by VARK learning styles. Please ensure the dataset is structured as follows:

dataset/
  Visual/
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
    ...
  Auditory/
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
    ...
  Read/Write/
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
    ...
  Kinesthetic/
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
    ...
Usage
Data Preparation:
Replace placeholder paths with your dataset directory.
Ensure the dataset is organized as described above.
Model Training:
Run the Python script to train the model.
The training process involves data loading, model architecture, compilation, and fitting.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model's performance using provided metrics.
Video Prediction:
Provide a video file path as input.
The script processes the video, predicts learning styles for each frame, and displays results.
Model Architecture
The model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract relevant features from images. The CNN consists of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, culminating in a softmax output layer for classification.

Contributions
Contributions to improve the model's accuracy, efficiency, or functionality are welcome. Potential areas for enhancement include:

Expanding the dataset
Experimenting with different CNN architectures(VGG16)
Incorporating data augmentation techniques
Developing a user-friendly interface
